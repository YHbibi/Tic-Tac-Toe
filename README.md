# Tic-Tac-Toe

# Description 

The game can be implemented using loops, conditional statements, and functions to manage the game flow, display the game board, and check for a win. 

---


##  Initialize the game board: 
Create a two-dimensional array of characters to represent the game board, with all positions initially set to a blank character.

---


##  Display the game board: 
Write a function to display the current state of the game board, showing each position as either X, O, or a blank character.

---


##  Player turn: 
Implement a loop that alternates between two players, with each player entering their move by specifying the row and column of the position they wish to place their symbol (X or O).

---


##  Check for a win: 
After each player's turn, write a function to check whether any player has won the game by having three of their symbols in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

---


##  Game end: 
End the game when either a player wins or all positions on the game board are filled.
